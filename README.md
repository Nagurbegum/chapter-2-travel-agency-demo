Chapter 2 - Travel Agency Demo
==============================
This is an example project for the Effective Business Process Management with JBoss BPM book, 
used in chapter 2. This example project is an online employee travel booking process project. It 
contains multiple web services for looking up data for the process and rules to calculate 
pricing. Furthermore, there are several tasks that can be activated to evaluate pricing and to 
review the final booking data before completing the booking.

	```
4. Start demo container

	```
	docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -p 9990:9990 effectivebpmwithjbossbpm/chapter-2-travel-agency-demo

   finish the task and process (isBookingConfirmed). All tasks have automated reassignment, meaning if not completed within 1 minute
